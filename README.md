Built a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on features like bedrooms, floors, and location.

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Seaborn & Matplotlib to analyze feature distributions.

Trained & evaluated the model using Sklearn with an RÂ² score of X.XX and reduced RMSE to $XXX,XXX.

Saved the model using Joblib, making it deployable in real-world applications.
